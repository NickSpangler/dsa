// A pattern with an OUTER FUNCTION
//and inside there is an INNER FUNCTION that itself is recursive

//Commonly used when COLLECTING a set, or building an array

//1) Define outter function
//2) Define collection; let results = []
//3) Define inner/recursive funciton, which updates results
//4) CALL inner function with original input
//5) Return results
