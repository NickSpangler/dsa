//Define Singly Linked List
//Compare and contrast with Arrays
//Implement insertion, removal, and traversal methods on Singly Linked Lists

//Linked list contains a HEAD, TAIL, and LENGTH propery

//Consist of nodes, and eac node has a VALUE and a POINTER to another node, or null

//COMPARISONS WITH ARRAYS
    //LISTS
    //do not have indexes!
    //connected via nodes with a NEXT pointer
    //random access is NOT allowed

    //ARRAYS
    //indexed in order
    //insertion and deletion can be expensive
    //can quickly be accessed at a specific index
