//TREES

//what is a tree?
//data structure with NODES, and Parent/Child relationships


//compare/contrast with linked lists
//Lists === LINEAR
//Trees === NON-LINEAR
//Technically, singly linked list is a sort of special tree case. (each node happens to only have one child)
//A node can ONLY point to a CHILD, only nodes BELOW them

//TERMINOLOGY
//ROOT = The Top node in a tree
//CHILD = A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root
//PARENT = converse notion of a child
//SIBLINGS = a group of nodes with the same parent
//LEAF = A node with no children
//EDGE = the connection between one node and another

//Trees / Binary Trees / Binary Search Trees
    //Binary Tree
        //Can have at most two children
        //But can have Zero, one, or two

    //Binary Search Trees
        //sorted in order
        //contain data that can be compared / sorted
        //every item that is less than, goes left
        //every item that is more than, goes right
