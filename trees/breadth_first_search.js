//BFS ITERATIVE STEPS

//create a queue (can just be an array) AND a variable to store values of nodes visited
    //push the root to the queue
//loop as long as there is something in the queue
    //dequeue a node and push the value of the node into the results variable
    //if there is a left property, push to queue
    //if there is a right property, push to queue
//return the variable that stores the values
