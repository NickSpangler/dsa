//A pattern involving creating a window, which can be either an array or a number
//from one position to another

//Depending on a condition, the window either increases or closes, (and then a new
//window is created)

//Useful for keeping traack of a subset of data in an array or string.

//EXAMPLE
//maxSubarraySum - accepts an array of integers and a number, n, and returns the maximum
//sum of n consecutive numbers in the array
