//Define Binary Heap
    //Very similar to binary search tree, but with different rules
    //MaxBinaryHeap - parent nodes are always larger than child nodes
    //MinBinaryHeap - parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

//Compare and Contrast min and max heaps

//implement methods on heaps

//Where are heaps useful in the real world? And what other data
//structures can be constructed from heaps?
